# 𖤣.𖥧.𖡼.⚘ What is the Tea Ceremony?
Known as _Chanoyu, 茶の湯_.

The tea ceremony is a formal multi-hour event that contains a course meal and later on two bowls of tea, first a thick tea and then a thin tea. For this ceremony, one should dress modest and humble. The japanese tea ceremony is traditionally hosted in a garden venue. although more modern takes have been approached. 

A sweet is served before the green tea. There's a specific way the tea is drank.
1. Pick up the cup with your right hand
2. Place it on the palm of your left hand
3. Turn the cup so it doesn't face you by 90 degrees clockwise
4. Once done, turn it so the cup faces the host
