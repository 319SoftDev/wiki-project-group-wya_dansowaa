# 𖤣.𖥧.𖡼.⚘ What was the Tea Ceremony?
  Known as Gongfu Tea, this is a way of preparing tea. However it's entrely different from the chinese wedding ceremony.

  Gongfu tea, not to be confused with the brand Kong Fu Tea, means the "Art of Tea" or "Skill of Tea". This art/skill spans from brewing the tea to also tasting the tea. 

  When brewing the tea, typically the tea pot would be small and made out of Yixing Clay. However Yixing pots typically are only made for one kind of tea, so porcelain pots are also used. Otherwise, one may brew the tea using guiwans, porcelain lids, cups, and coasters.

Whislt brewing the tea, in a sense one could call it purifying it as the first pour of hot water is used to wash the tea leaves. Inbetween it's optional to wash the tea pets with the tea water. 

Tea pets are often brought along in tea ceremonies  as companions, bringers of luck, or simply for decoration.
