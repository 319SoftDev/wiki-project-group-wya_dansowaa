# ð–¤£.ð–¥§.ð–¡¼.âš˜ What is the Tea Ceremony?
  Originally started off as tea time under the rule of the British, now it's much more than that, being a time to settle down and ignore the stress of life. 


  The tea is soaked in spices, such as:
  - green cardamom
  - cloves
  - coriander
  - black peppercorn
  - cinnamon
  - ginger
  - coriander
  - star anise
_These spices also help improve the immune systems._

The tea ceremony is used as relaxation time as well as a show of hospitality.
