#### Directions ####
#### Boba ####
- Make the milk base:
- Place 2 cups whole milk, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt in a large saucepan (the wider, the better).
- Bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking until the sugar is dissolved.
- Reduce the heat as needed to maintain a brisk simmer. Cook, whisking and scraping down the sides of the saucepan with a flexible spatula every 5 minutes, until reduced to 1 cup, 35 to 60 minutes (a wider saucepan will be faster). The mixture will be thickened to the consistency of gravy and slightly darker (it will not be perfectly smooth). Meanwhile, make the tea.
#### Sweatened Milk ####
- Bring 5 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.
- Add 12 black tea bags or 1/2 cup loose-leaf black tea.
- Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer for 5 minutes.
- Take the saucepan off the heat and let the tea steep for 10 minutes.
- Pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium heatproof bowl. Gently press on the tea leaves or tea bags with a spoon to release as much liquid as possible; discard the tea bags or leaves.
- When the milk base is ready, transfer it to a blender, making sure to scrape the mixture from the sides of the saucepan into the blender; blend on low speed until smooth.
- Add the tea and blend again on low speed until smooth. To serve hot, pour back into a clean saucepan and reheat over medium heat if desired. To serve cold, refrigerate until chilled, rewhisk or reblend, and pour over ice.
