# Different types of tea
There are many different types of tea in the world, matcha, chai, pu' er, oolong, earl grey, etc. However people would say that there would be six main types of "true teas" such as white, yellow, green, oolong, black, and dark (pu-erh)â€”all are derived from the Camellia sinensis plant, they have different variations depending on how long you steep the tea and what kind of process you use for it. "Herbal teas," also known as tisanes, are different since they come from other plants, such as chamomile, peppermint, and rooibos, and are generally caffeine-free.  

True Teas (from Camellia sinensis) The differences between these teas is determined by how different the leaves are being processed after being picked, also the degree of oxeygen they are exposed to: 

White Tea: The least processed, with minimal oxidation. 

Yellow Tea: A rare type that involves a unique, slow drying and "sweating" process. 

Green Tea: Leaves that are quickly heated after plucking to stop oxidation, resulting in a fresh, vegetal flavor. 

Oolong Tea: Leaves are partially oxidized, creating a wide spectrum of flavors between green and black teas. 

Black Tea: The leaves are fully oxidized, producing a robust, dark-colored beverage. 

Dark Tea (Pu-erh): A post-fermented tea, meaning it goes through a process of aging and fermentation after the initial processing.
