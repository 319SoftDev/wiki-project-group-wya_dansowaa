# Different tea intensities

With the camelia plant, there are different processes and intensities you can make with the tea. As you adjust the water and tea ratio, you adjust the flavor and the different medicinal properties it has.
You can also adjust it by using more leaves for a stronger more flavorful tea; you can also adjust the steep time, allowing longer brewing for more flavor extraction; and finally change the water temp, hotter / high temps extract flavor more. Different tea types also have inherent intensities, with black teas generally being the strongest and white teas the lightest. This is due to their havesting process.
